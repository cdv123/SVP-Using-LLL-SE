# Solving SVP Using LLL and SE Enumeration

This project implements SE enumeration and LLL to solve the shortest vector problem.
To test, use make test
To run on an input, use make and then use ./runme [INPUT HERE]
The input should be linear independent, of full rank and vectors should be written as[a b c] where a b and c are numbers.
There should be a space between vectors when defining the basis.
